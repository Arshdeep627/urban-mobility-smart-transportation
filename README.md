# urban-mobility-smart-transportation
The Urban Mobility and Smart Transportation Network is a comprehensive system designed to optimize public transportation, reduce traffic congestion, and improve overall mobility in a metropolitan area.  

CI/CD Pipeline for Urban Mobility and Smart Transportation Network
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a CI/CD pipeline for the Urban Mobility and Smart Transportation Network, a TypeScript-based application focused on optimizing public transportation, traffic management, and mobility in urban areas. The goal of this pipeline is to automatically build, test, and deploy the application using core DevOps practices, facilitating seamless and reliable updates.

# Local Setup and Running the Application

Prerequisites:
Node.js (v16 or later)
npm (v7 or later)
Docker (if running the application within a container)
Git for version control

# Steps to Run Locally:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/urban-mobility-smart-transportation.git
cd urban-mobility-smart-transportation

Install dependencies:
npm install

Build the TypeScript application:
npm run build

Start the application:
npm start

Access the application locally at: http://localhost:3000
CI/CD Pipeline Workflow
Git Workflow and Branching Strategy

The project follows a Feature Branch Workflow:

Main Branch: Production-ready code. Deployments occur from this branch.
Develop Branch: For integrating new features and bug fixes before merging into the main branch.
Feature Branches: Each new feature is developed on a separate branch and merged into the develop branch via a pull request (PR) after code review.
The branching strategy is documented here for clarity and consistency.

CI Pipeline Setup with GitHub Actions
The CI pipeline is triggered by any push to the develop branch. It performs the following steps:

Install Dependencies: The pipeline first installs the dependencies using npm ci for faster, consistent installation.

steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci


Lint TypeScript Code: Lints the code using tslint to ensure code quality and consistency:
steps:
  - name: Lint TypeScript code
    run: npm run lint

Run Unit Tests: Runs automated tests using Jest or Mocha (if applicable):
steps:
  - name: Run unit tests
    run: npm test


Build TypeScript Code: Compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript:
  - name: Build the application
    run: npm run build

Build and Push Docker Image: The Docker image for the application is built and pushed to Docker Hub:
steps:
  - name: Build and push Docker image
    run: |
      docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/urban-mobility-smart-transportation:latest .
      docker push your-dockerhub-username/urban-mobility-smart-transportation:latest

# CD Pipeline Setup
The CD pipeline deploys the containerized application after successful completion of the CI pipeline and is triggered by merging code into the main branch. It includes:

Trigger Deployment: The pipeline will trigger a deployment based on a Docker image push or merge into the main branch.

Security and Monitoring:

Secret Management: The pipeline uses GitHub Secrets to securely handle sensitive information like Docker credentials.
Basic Security Scan: The pipeline integrates npm audit or similar tools to check for dependency vulnerabilities:
steps:
  - name: Run security scan
    run: npm audit

# DevOps Principles Applied

Continuous Integration: The pipeline ensures code quality by running tests, linting, and building the application automatically for every push to the develop branch.

Continuous Deployment: Automatically deploys the application by pushing the Docker image to a registry and (if integrated) deploying it to a cloud platform.

Containerization: Uses Docker to containerize the application for consistency across environments.

Automated Testing: Tests are run as part of the pipeline to catch errors early.

Security Integration: Incorporates basic security practices, including secret management and dependency vulnerability scanning.

# Report on DevOps Implementation
This CI/CD pipeline effectively demonstrates key DevOps principles:

Automated Workflows: The automated GitHub Actions workflow ensures that the application is consistently built and tested for every change.

Containerization: Docker allows for easy deployment and scalability of the application across environments.

Collaboration: The feature branch workflow and continuous integration enhance team collaboration and reduce the risk of introducing bugs into the production environment.

Security: Basic security measures, including secret management and vulnerability scanning, are integrated into the pipeline, making the system more robust and secure.

# Documentation
Local setup and run instructions: Provided for developers to easily set up and run the application locally.
CI/CD pipeline workflow: Detailed steps on how the pipeline works, ensuring smooth integration and deployment.
DevOps principles: Highlighted key principles applied, emphasizing the pipeline’s role in improving code quality, security, and collaboration.


# Conclusion
This CI/CD pipeline demonstrates a solid implementation of DevOps practices, providing a reliable and efficient process for building, testing, and deploying a TypeScript-based application. The pipeline contributes to better collaboration, faster delivery, and improved software quality.
